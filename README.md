The red circles are harm objects. The green are benefits.

Each harm/green speed is genereated randomly between thresholds, and
as each level you go higher, the speed gets faster.

Controls to play the game are up and down arrow keys only.

The game begins with 2 benefits objects, and 5 harm objects and they all
move at different speeds.

Player begins at level 1, and every 5 scores they get, they move on
to the next level. When you move on to the next level, the speed of the
balls go faster and faster as higher levels you get. You also only have
5 lives.

updated:to 5 lives to make it more fun.
